//Peer Review: Awesome job! Your weather application works perfectly. I liked that you added a function to check for the most frequent weather condition of the day. (I might add that to my application in the future.) I do have just a few suggestions: 1. Make the weather icon for today a bit smaller to better match the prototype 2. If possible, perhaps make the icons filled to better match the prototype. If not, it still looks great. 3. Maybe make the magnifying glass a clickable search button as well?
